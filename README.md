## Documentation & Use Cases
https://frinxio.github.io/Frinx-docs/

## Requirements
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
* License for FRINX ODL (you can find a trial license in the "Installation Guide" section below)

min 16GB RAM & min 4 vCPUs with normal startup, and 5GB RAM & 2 vCPUs with minimal config has been successfully tested for POCs and demos. 

### Tested on
* Ubuntu 16.04 / 18.04 /
* docker 18.03.1-ce, v18.06.1-ce 
* docker-compose 1.21.2, v1.22.0

## Installation preparation

### Docker

To install the Ubuntu repository version, execute the following command

	sudo apt-get install docker.io

Check the version with

	docker --version

You'll see output similar to this:

	Docker version 18.06.1-ce, build e68fc7a

### Docker Compose

To install Docker Compose, at first, install the `curl` command

Type the following apt or apt-get command:
	
	sudo apt install curl
	
After installing `curl`, use following command to get *Docker Compose*:

	sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o 	/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
	
_Note: You can download the latest version of Docker Composer after checking Release Notes https://github.com/docker/compose/releases and finding the latest version, e.g. 1.23.2. Then you can edit the download link release version number to get the latest release._

## Installation Guide
##### Trial license
We offer a one month trial license. No signup needed!
License token:
```
0e57a786f7dbd27fa77db684cf3b234d6f23ed784e52cbfb107fd4317ba2646c66f7a141b0e823946d8f9d956852c95d33dc82f945779b1c9969049e94935b2a
```

#### Get the project
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FRINXio/FRINX-machine.git
```
Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd FRINX-machine
```

 
#### Installation

The installation script `install.sh` is in the FRINX-machine folder. 

*The installation script does the following things:*
* Updates project submodules (e.g. conductor)
* Copies license token
* Pulls conductor project parts from maven repository
* Builds conductor-server .jar file
* Pulls and creates docker images
* Creates external volumes for data persistence


We recommend to run the install script as regular user and not as sudo, so all files (e.g. netinfra utils) can be edited by the regular user later. 

Installation with the trial license token:
```
./install.sh -l 0e57a786f7dbd27fa77db684cf3b234d6f23ed784e52cbfb107fd4317ba2646c66f7a141b0e823946d8f9d956852c95d33dc82f945779b1c9969049e94935b2a
```

#### Startup
The startup script `startup.sh` can be found in the FRINX-machine folder.
Here is what it does:
* Creates the docker containers from the images and starts them.
* Imports workflow definitions.


Docker needs privileged mode, so `startup.sh` should be executed with sudo. Otherwise it will prompt for password while executing.
```bash
sudo ./startup.sh
```
Min 16GB RAM & min 4 vCPUs with normal startup are recommended.

##### Minimal startup
```bash
sudo ./startup.sh -m
```
Starts application with lower RAM usage. Min 5GB RAM & min 2 vCPUs with minimal startup are recommended.

#### Teardown
The `teardown.sh` script in the FRINX-machine folder:
* Stops and removes containers
* Does not remove external volumes

Using docker, also needs privileged mode:
```bash
sudo ./teardown.sh
```

## Removal of external volumes
#### **Caution all data will be lost!**

To remove the external volumes use:
```bash
sudo docker volume rm redis_data elastic_data
```
Docker expects external volumes to exist when starting the containers.
They can be created with:
```bash
sudo docker volume create --name=redis_data
sudo docker volume create --name=elastic_data
```

### GUI

* localhost:5000 --> FRINX workflow GUI
* localhost:5601 --> Kibana (for log and inventory access)
* localhost:8888 --> FRINXit (CLI for FRINX ODL)
